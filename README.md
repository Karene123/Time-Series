## About The Project
Artifical intelligence has been the new topic of discussions across different industries. It presents many benefits. The goal of this project is to develop a Transformer based AI model that can improve the prediction of inflation as a macroeconomic indicator. This model will be compared to traditional time series models such as ARIMA, VAR, and LSTM. This is an attempt to demonstrate the efficacy of machine learning to enhance accuracy.
